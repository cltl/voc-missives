# VOC missives

This repository provides code for Named Entity Recognition on the VOC [Generale Missiven](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vocgeneralemissiven) 
 for [Clariah WP6](https://www.clariah.nl/en/work-packages/focus-areas/text?layout=blog).


Preprocessing involves converting TEI input missives to NAF NLP format,
and handling the integration of manual and system NER annotations. 

## Overview
The repository consists of three parts:
* code for the conversion of the missives between different [formats](docs/formats.md) 
* code for missive extraction from [TextFabric](tf/README.md)
* code for [NER](ner/README.md) experiments
